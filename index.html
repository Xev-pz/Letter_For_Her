        I wanna say sorry for being toxic and an overthinker.
        Im just really scared of losing you because di ko alam yun gagawin ko.
        Part of me was so obsessed with you to the point na nagiging toxic na
        and makes you feel overwhelmed that's why you pull away.
        But even so, I still choose you.

        Nasanay lang kasi ako sa attention na binigay mo sakin the first 2 months
        of talking with you. Every time we chat the vibes, the energy, the excitement
        clicks. But the situation changed since both of us naging busy and i failed to accept 
        the fact na things change as time goes by.
